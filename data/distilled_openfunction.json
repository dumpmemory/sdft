To provide custom values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it using  ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup . Once youâve created a DB cluster parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB cluster using  ModifyDBCluster . When you associate a new DB cluster parameter group with a running DB cluster, you need to reboot the DB instances in the DB cluster without failover for the new DB cluster parameter group and associated settings to take effect.WarningAfter you create a DB cluster parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB cluster that uses that DB cluster parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon Neptune to fully complete the create action before the DB cluster parameter group is used as the default for a new DB cluster. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined by the character_set_database parameter. You can use the Parameter Groups option of the Amazon Neptune console or the  DescribeDBClusterParameters command to verify that your DB cluster parameter group has been created or modified.\nParameters:\n1. db_cluster_parameter_group_name - The name of the DB cluster parameter group.\nConstraints:\n\nMust match the name of an existing DBClusterParameterGroup.\n\n\nNoteThis value is stored as a lowercase string.\n2. db_parameter_group_family - The DB cluster parameter group family name.

With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nIn an  UpdateRegexMatchSet request, RegexMatchSetUpdate specifies whether to insert or delete a  RegexMatchTuple and includes the settings for the RegexMatchTuple .\nAction -> (string)\n\nSpecifies whether to insert or delete a  RegexMatchTuple .\nRegexMatchTuple -> (structure)\n\nInformation about the part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect and the identifier of the regular expression (regex) pattern that you want AWS WAF to search for. If you specify DELETE for the value of Action , the RegexMatchTuple values must exactly match the values in the RegexMatchTuple that you want to delete from the RegexMatchSet .\nFieldToMatch -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies where in a web request to look for the RegexPatternSet .\nType -> (string)\n\nThe part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string. Parts of a request that you can search include the following:\n\nHEADER : A specified request header, for example, the value of the User-Agent or Referer header. If you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of the header in Data .\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\nQUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.\nURI : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .\nSINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 characters.\nALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but rather than inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString .\n\n\nData -> (string)\n\nWhen the value of Type is HEADER , enter the name of the header that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is not case sensitive.\nWhen the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter name is not case sensitive.\nIf the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .\n\n\nTextTransformation -> (string)\n\nText transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs the transformation on RegexPatternSet before inspecting a request for a match.\nYou can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.\n\nCMD_LINE\nWhen youâre concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system commandline command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to perform the following transformations:\n\nDelete the following characters: â â ^\nDelete spaces before the following characters: / (\nReplace the following characters with a space: , ;\nReplace multiple spaces with one space\nConvert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)\n\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE\nUse this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):\n\nf, formfeed, decimal 12\nt, tab, decimal 9\nn, newline, decimal 10\nr, carriage return, decimal 13\nv, vertical tab, decimal 11\nnon-breaking space, decimal 160\n\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple spaces with one space.\nHTML_ENTITY_DECODE\n\nUse this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs the following operations:\n\nReplaces (ampersand)quot; with \"\nReplaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking space, decimal 160\nReplaces (ampersand)lt; with a âless thanâ symbol\nReplaces (ampersand)gt; with >\nReplaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh; , with the corresponding characters\nReplaces characters that are represented in decimal format, (ampersand)#nnnn; , with the corresponding characters\n\n\nLOWERCASE\nUse this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).\n\nURL_DECODE\nUse this option to decode a URL-encoded value.\n\nNONE\nSpecify NONE if you donât want to perform any text transformations.\n\nRegexPatternSetId -> (string)\n\nThe RegexPatternSetId for a RegexPatternSet . You use RegexPatternSetId to get information about a RegexPatternSet (see  GetRegexPatternSet ), update a RegexPatternSet (see  UpdateRegexPatternSet ), insert a RegexPatternSet into a RegexMatchSet or delete one from a RegexMatchSet (see  UpdateRegexMatchSet ), and delete an RegexPatternSet from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRegexPatternSet ).\n\nRegexPatternSetId is returned by  CreateRegexPatternSet and by  ListRegexPatternSets .\n3. change_token - The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .\nFormat your response as a single string using keyword arguments.",

For information about creating an SMB location, see Creating a location for SMB .\nParameters:\n1. location_arn - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SMB location to update.\n2. subdirectory - The subdirectory in the SMB file system that is used to read data from the SMB source location or write data to the SMB destination. The SMB path should be a path thatâs exported by the SMB server, or a subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can be mounted by other SMB clients in your network.\n\nNoteSubdirectory must be specified with forward slashes. For example, /path/to/folder .\nTo transfer all the data in the folder that you specified, DataSync must have permissions to mount the SMB share and to access all the data in that share. To ensure this, do either of the following:\n\nEnsure that the user/password specified belongs to the user who can mount the share and who has the appropriate permissions for all of the files and directories that you want DataSync to access.\nUse credentials of a member of the Backup Operators group to mount the share.\n\nDoing either of these options enables the agent to access the data. For the agent to access directories, you must also enable all execute access.\n3. user - The user who can mount the share has the permissions to access files and folders in the SMB share.\n4. domain - The name of the Windows domain that the SMB server belongs to.\n5. password - The password of the user who can mount the share has the permissions to access files and folders in the SMB share.\n6. agent_arns - The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents to use for a Simple Message Block (SMB) location.\n(string)\n7. mount_options - Specifies the version of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol that DataSync uses to access an SMB file server.\nVersion -> (string)\n\nBy default, DataSync automatically chooses an SMB protocol version based on negotiation with your SMB file server.

This is the recommended option. If you instead choose a specific version that your file server doesnât support, you may get an Operation Not Supported error.\nSMB3 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 3.0.2.\nSMB2 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.1.\nSMB2_0 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.0.\nSMB1 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 1.0.\n\n\nNoteThe SMB1 option isnât available when creating an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP location .\nFormat your response as a single string using keyword arguments.",

Sends a message to a user with a code that they must return in a VerifyUserAttribute request.NoteAmazon Cognito doesnât evaluate Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you canât use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you canât grant IAM permissions in policies. For more information about authorization models in Amazon Cognito, see Using the Amazon Cognito native and OIDC APIs .NoteThis action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.\nParameters:\n1. access_token - A non-expired access token for the user whose attribute verification code you want to generate.\n2. attribute_name - The attribute name returned by the server response to get the user attribute verification code.\n3. client_metadata - A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers.\nYou create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the GetUserAttributeVerificationCode API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the custom message trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your GetUserAttributeVerificationCode request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.\nFor more information, see Customizing user pool Workflows with Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .\n\nNoteWhen you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon Cognito wonât do the following:\n\nStore the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesnât include triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter serves no purpose.\nValidate the ClientMetadata value.\nEncrypt the ClientMetadata value. Donât use Amazon Cognito to provide sensitive information.\n\n\nkey -> (string)\nvalue -> (string)\nFormat your response as a single string using keyword arguments.",

App Runner requires this resource when you create or update App Runner services and you require non-default auto scaling settings. You can share an auto scaling configuration across multiple services.Configure a higher MinSize to increase the spread of your App Runner service over more Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region. The tradeoff is a higher minimal cost.See also: AWS API Documentation\n\nParameters:\n1. auto_scaling_configuration_name - A name for the auto scaling configuration.

You canât use it to create a new auto scaling configuration, and you canât create a revision of it.\nWhen you want to use your own auto scaling configuration for your App Runner service, create a configuration with a different name , and then provide it when you create or update your service.\n2. max_concurrency - The maximum number of concurrent requests that you want an instance to process. If the number of concurrent requests exceeds this limit, App Runner scales up your service.\nDefault: 100\n3. min_size - The minimum number of instances that App Runner provisions for your service. The service always has at least MinSize provisioned instances. Some of them actively serve traffic. The rest of them (provisioned and inactive instances) are a cost-effective compute capacity reserve and are ready to be quickly activated. You pay for memory usage of all the provisioned instances. You pay for CPU usage of only the active subset.\nApp Runner temporarily doubles the number of provisioned instances during deployments, to maintain the same capacity for both old and new code.\nDefault: 1\n4. max_size - The maximum number of instances that your service scales up to.

To do this, you can set Entry to / and set Target to the HomeDirectory parameter value.\nThe following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot .\n\n[ { \"Entry\": \"/\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]\n(structure)\n\nRepresents an object that contains entries and targets for HomeDirectoryMappings .\nThe following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot .\n\n[ { \"Entry\": \"/\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]\nEntry -> (string)\n\nRepresents an entry for HomeDirectoryMappings .\nTarget -> (string)\n\nRepresents the map target that is used in a HomeDirectorymapEntry .\n4. policy - A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a userâs access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include ${Transfer:UserName} , ${Transfer:HomeDirectory} , and ${Transfer:HomeBucket} .\n\nNoteThis policy applies only when the domain of ServerId is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use session policies.\nFor session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the Policy argument.\nFor an example of a session policy, see Example session policy .\nFor more information, see AssumeRole in the Amazon Web ServicesSecurity Token Service API Reference .\n5. posix_profile - The full POSIX identity, including user ID (Uid ), group ID (Gid ), and any secondary groups IDs (SecondaryGids ), that controls your usersâ access to your Amazon EFS file systems. The POSIX permissions that are set on files and directories in your file system determine the level of access your users get when transferring files into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.\nUid -> (long)\n\nThe POSIX user ID used for all EFS operations by this user.\nGid -> (long)\n\nThe POSIX group ID used for all EFS operations by this user.\nSecondaryGids -> (list)\n\nThe secondary POSIX group IDs used for all EFS operations by this user.\n(long)\n6. role - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that controls your usersâ access to your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to access your resources when servicing your usersâ transfer requests.\n7. server_id - A system-assigned unique identifier for a server instance. This is the specific server that you added your user to.\n8. external_id - A unique identifier that is required to identify specific groups within your directory. The users of the group that you associate have access to your Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS resources over the enabled protocols using Transfer Family. If you know the group name, you can view the SID values by running the following command using Windows PowerShell.\n\nGet-ADGroup -Filter {samAccountName -like \"*YourGroupName* *\"} -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid\nIn that command, replace YourGroupName with the name of your Active Directory group.\nThe regular expression used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces.

To provide custom values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it using  ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup . Once youâve created a DB cluster parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB cluster using  ModifyDBCluster . When you associate a new DB cluster parameter group with a running DB cluster, you need to reboot the DB instances in the DB cluster without failover for the new DB cluster parameter group and associated settings to take effect.WarningAfter you create a DB cluster parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB cluster that uses that DB cluster parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon Neptune to fully complete the create action before the DB cluster parameter group is used as the default for a new DB cluster. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined by the character_set_database parameter. You can use the Parameter Groups option of the Amazon Neptune console or the  DescribeDBClusterParameters command to verify that your DB cluster parameter group has been created or modified.\nParameters:\n1. db_cluster_parameter_group_name - The name of the DB cluster parameter group.\nConstraints:\n\nMust match the name of an existing DBClusterParameterGroup.\n\n\nNoteThis value is stored as a lowercase string.\n2. db_parameter_group_family - The DB cluster parameter group family name.

With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nIn an  UpdateRegexMatchSet request, RegexMatchSetUpdate specifies whether to insert or delete a  RegexMatchTuple and includes the settings for the RegexMatchTuple .\nAction -> (string)\n\nSpecifies whether to insert or delete a  RegexMatchTuple .\nRegexMatchTuple -> (structure)\n\nInformation about the part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect and the identifier of the regular expression (regex) pattern that you want AWS WAF to search for. If you specify DELETE for the value of Action , the RegexMatchTuple values must exactly match the values in the RegexMatchTuple that you want to delete from the RegexMatchSet .\nFieldToMatch -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies where in a web request to look for the RegexPatternSet .\nType -> (string)\n\nThe part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string. Parts of a request that you can search include the following:\n\nHEADER : A specified request header, for example, the value of the User-Agent or Referer header. If you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of the header in Data .\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\nQUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.\nURI : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .\nSINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 characters.\nALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but rather than inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString .\n\n\nData -> (string)\n\nWhen the value of Type is HEADER , enter the name of the header that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is not case sensitive.\nWhen the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter name is not case sensitive.\nIf the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .\n\n\nTextTransformation -> (string)\n\nText transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs the transformation on RegexPatternSet before inspecting a request for a match.\nYou can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.\n\nCMD_LINE\nWhen youâre concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system commandline command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to perform the following transformations:\n\nDelete the following characters: â â ^\nDelete spaces before the following characters: / (\nReplace the following characters with a space: , ;\nReplace multiple spaces with one space\nConvert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)\n\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE\nUse this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):\n\nf, formfeed, decimal 12\nt, tab, decimal 9\nn, newline, decimal 10\nr, carriage return, decimal 13\nv, vertical tab, decimal 11\nnon-breaking space, decimal 160\n\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple spaces with one space.\nHTML_ENTITY_DECODE\n\nUse this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs the following operations:\n\nReplaces (ampersand)quot; with \"\nReplaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking space, decimal 160\nReplaces (ampersand)lt; with a âless thanâ symbol\nReplaces (ampersand)gt; with >\nReplaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh; , with the corresponding characters\nReplaces characters that are represented in decimal format, (ampersand)#nnnn; , with the corresponding characters\n\n\nLOWERCASE\nUse this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).\n\nURL_DECODE\nUse this option to decode a URL-encoded value.\n\nNONE\nSpecify NONE if you donât want to perform any text transformations.\n\nRegexPatternSetId -> (string)\n\nThe RegexPatternSetId for a RegexPatternSet . You use RegexPatternSetId to get information about a RegexPatternSet (see  GetRegexPatternSet ), update a RegexPatternSet (see  UpdateRegexPatternSet ), insert a RegexPatternSet into a RegexMatchSet or delete one from a RegexMatchSet (see  UpdateRegexMatchSet ), and delete an RegexPatternSet from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRegexPatternSet ).\n\nRegexPatternSetId is returned by  CreateRegexPatternSet and by  ListRegexPatternSets .\n3. change_token - The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .\nFormat your response as a single string using keyword arguments.",

The path should be such that it can be mounted by other SMB clients in your network.\n\nNoteSubdirectory must be specified with forward slashes. For example, /path/to/folder .\nTo transfer all the data in the folder that you specified, DataSync must have permissions to mount the SMB share and to access all the data in that share. To ensure this, do either of the following:\n\nEnsure that the user/password specified belongs to the user who can mount the share and who has the appropriate permissions for all of the files and directories that you want DataSync to access.\nUse credentials of a member of the Backup Operators group to mount the share.\n\nDoing either of these options enables the agent to access the data. For the agent to access directories, you must also enable all execute access.\n3. user - The user who can mount the share has the permissions to access files and folders in the SMB share.\n4. domain - The name of the Windows domain that the SMB server belongs to.\n5. password - The password of the user who can mount the share has the permissions to access files and folders in the SMB share.\n6. agent_arns - The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents to use for a Simple Message Block (SMB) location.\n(string)\n7. mount_options - Specifies the version of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol that DataSync uses to access an SMB file server.\nVersion -> (string)\n\nBy default, DataSync automatically chooses an SMB protocol version based on negotiation with your SMB file server.

This is the recommended option. If you instead choose a specific version that your file server doesnât support, you may get an Operation Not Supported error.\nSMB3 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 3.0.2.\nSMB2 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.1.\nSMB2_0 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.0.\nSMB1 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 1.0.\n\n\nNoteThe SMB1 option isnât available when creating an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP location .\nFormat your response as a single string using keyword arguments.",

Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.\nParameters:\n1. access_token - A non-expired access token for the user whose attribute verification code you want to generate.\n2. attribute_name - The attribute name returned by the server response to get the user attribute verification code.\n3. client_metadata - A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers.\nYou create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the GetUserAttributeVerificationCode API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the custom message trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your GetUserAttributeVerificationCode request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.\nFor more information, see Customizing user pool Workflows with Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .\n\nNoteWhen you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon Cognito wonât do the following:\n\nStore the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesnât include triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter serves no purpose.\nValidate the ClientMetadata value.\nEncrypt the ClientMetadata value. Donât use Amazon Cognito to provide sensitive information.\n\n\nkey -> (string)\nvalue -> (string)\nFormat your response as a single string using keyword arguments.",

AppConfig supports the following growth types:\n\nLinear : For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment by increments of the growth factor evenly distributed over the deployment time. For example, a linear deployment that uses a growth factor of 20 initially makes the configuration available to 20 percent of the targets. After 1/5th of the deployment time has passed, the system updates the percentage to 40 percent. This continues until 100% of the targets are set to receive the deployed configuration.\nExponential : For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment exponentially using the following formula: G*(2^N) . In this formula, G is the growth factor specified by the user and N is the number of steps until the configuration is deployed to all targets. For example, if you specify a growth factor of 2, then the system rolls out the configuration as follows:\n2*(2^0)\n2*(2^1)\n2*(2^2)\n\nExpressed numerically, the deployment rolls out as follows: 2% of the targets, 4% of the targets, 8% of the targets, and continues until the configuration has been deployed to all targets.\nPossible values:\n\nLINEAR\nEXPONENTIAL\nFormat your response as a single string using keyword arguments.",

For more information about paths, see Access Objects . You can identify an object in one of the following ways:\n\n$ObjectIdentifier - An object identifier is an opaque string provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the system will provide you with the identifier of the created object. An objectâs identifier is immutable and no two objects will ever share the same object identifier. To identify an object with ObjectIdentifier, the ObjectIdentifier must be wrapped in double quotes.\n/some/path - Identifies the object based on path\n#SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call\n3. consistency_level - The consistency level at which to retrieve the object information.\nPossible values:\n\nSERIALIZABLE\nEVENTUAL\nFormat your response as a single string using keyword arguments.",

If you set it to PATH , the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it LOGICAL , you need to provide mappings in the HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.\nPossible values:\n\nPATH\nLOGICAL\n3. home_directory_mappings - Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where Entry shows how the path is made visible and Target is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in Target . This value can be set only when HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL .\nThe following is an Entry and Target pair example.\n\n[ { \"Entry\": \"/directory1\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]\nIn most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory (âchroot â). To do this, you can set Entry to / and set Target to the HomeDirectory parameter value.\nThe following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot .\n\n[ { \"Entry\": \"/\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]\n(structure)\n\nRepresents an object that contains entries and targets for HomeDirectoryMappings .\nThe following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot .\n\n[ { \"Entry\": \"/\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]\nEntry -> (string)\n\nRepresents an entry for HomeDirectoryMappings .\nTarget -> (string)\n\nRepresents the map target that is used in a HomeDirectorymapEntry .\n4. policy - A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a userâs access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include ${Transfer:UserName} , ${Transfer:HomeDirectory} , and ${Transfer:HomeBucket} .\n\nNoteThis policy applies only when the domain of ServerId is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use session policies.\nFor session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the Policy argument.\nFor an example of a session policy, see Example session policy .\nFor more information, see AssumeRole in the Amazon Web ServicesSecurity Token Service API Reference .\n5. posix_profile - The full POSIX identity, including user ID (Uid ), group ID (Gid ), and any secondary groups IDs (SecondaryGids ), that controls your usersâ access to your Amazon EFS file systems. The POSIX permissions that are set on files and directories in your file system determine the level of access your users get when transferring files into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.\nUid -> (long)\n\nThe POSIX user ID used for all EFS operations by this user.\nGid -> (long)\n\nThe POSIX group ID used for all EFS operations by this user.\nSecondaryGids -> (list)\n\nThe secondary POSIX group IDs used for all EFS operations by this user.\n(long)\n6. role - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that controls your usersâ access to your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to access your resources when servicing your usersâ transfer requests.\n7. server_id - A system-assigned unique identifier for a server instance. This is the specific server that you added your user to.\n8. external_id - A unique identifier that is required to identify specific groups within your directory. The users of the group that you associate have access to your Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS resources over the enabled protocols using Transfer Family. If you know the group name, you can view the SID values by running the following command using Windows PowerShell.\n\nGet-ADGroup -Filter {samAccountName -like \"*YourGroupName* *\"} -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid\nIn that command, replace YourGroupName with the name of your Active Directory group.\nThe regular expression used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces.

However, this type of managed permission is visible to only the resource share owner, and the associated resource share canât be modified by using RAM.Before you use  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy , you should first run this operation to ensure that you have an appropriate customer managed permission that can be associated with the promoted resource share.NoteYou canât modify a CREATED_FROM_POLICY resource share so you canât associate the new customer managed permission by using ReplacePermsissionAssociations . However, if you use  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy , that operation automatically associates the fully manageable customer managed permission to the newly promoted STANDARD resource share.See also: AWS API Documentation\n\nParameters:\n1. permission_arn - Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CREATED_FROM_POLICY permission that you want to promote. You can get this Amazon Resource Name (ARN) by calling the  ListResourceSharePermissions operation.\n2. name - Specifies a name for the promoted customer managed permission.\n3. client_token - Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend that you use a UUID type of value. .\nIf you donât provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates a random one for you.\nIf you retry the operation with the same ClientToken , but with different parameters, the retry fails with an IdempotentParameterMismatch error.\nFormat your response as a single string using keyword arguments.",

To provide custom values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it using  ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup . Once youâve created a DB cluster parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB cluster using  ModifyDBCluster . When you associate a new DB cluster parameter group with a running DB cluster, you need to reboot the DB instances in the DB cluster without failover for the new DB cluster parameter group and associated settings to take effect.WarningAfter you create a DB cluster parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB cluster that uses that DB cluster parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon Neptune to fully complete the create action before the DB cluster parameter group is used as the default for a new DB cluster. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined by the character_set_database parameter. You can use the Parameter Groups option of the Amazon Neptune console or the  DescribeDBClusterParameters command to verify that your DB cluster parameter group has been created or modified.\nParameters:\n1. db_cluster_parameter_group_name - The name of the DB cluster parameter group.\nConstraints:\n\nMust match the name of an existing DBClusterParameterGroup.\n\n\nNoteThis value is stored as a lowercase string.\n2. db_parameter_group_family - The DB cluster parameter group family name. A DB cluster parameter group can be associated with one and only one DB cluster parameter group family, and can be applied only to a DB cluster running a database engine and engine version compatible with that DB cluster parameter group family.\n3. description - The description for the DB cluster parameter group.\n4. tags - The tags to be assigned to the new DB cluster parameter group.\n(structure)\n\nMetadata assigned to an Amazon Neptune resource consisting of a key-value pair.\nKey -> (string)\n\nA key is the required name of the tag. The string value can be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length and canât be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain the set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, â_â, â.â, â/â, â=â, â+â, â-â (Java regex: â^([\\p{L}\\p{Z}\\p{N}_.:/=+-]*)$â).\nValue -> (string)\n\nA value is the optional value of the tag.

You can also use tags for tag-based access control.\nTo learn more about tagging, see Tagging resources .\nKey -> (string)\n\nThe first part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For example, in the tag Department:Sales , the key is âDepartmentâ.\nValue -> (string)\n\nThe second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For example, in the tag Department:Sales , the value is âSalesâ.\nNote that you can set the value of a tag to an empty string, but you canât set the value of a tag to null. Omitting the tag value is the same as using an empty string.\n6. data_access_role_arn - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that has permissions to access the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input files (in this case, your custom vocabulary). If the role that you specify doesnât have the appropriate permissions to access the specified Amazon S3 location, your request fails.\nIAM role ARNs have the format arn:partition:iam::account:role/role-name-with-path .

For the agent to access directories, you must also enable all execute access.\n3. user - The user who can mount the share has the permissions to access files and folders in the SMB share.\n4. domain - The name of the Windows domain that the SMB server belongs to.\n5. password - The password of the user who can mount the share has the permissions to access files and folders in the SMB share.\n6. agent_arns - The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents to use for a Simple Message Block (SMB) location.\n(string)\n7. mount_options - Specifies the version of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol that DataSync uses to access an SMB file server.\nVersion -> (string)\n\nBy default, DataSync automatically chooses an SMB protocol version based on negotiation with your SMB file server. You also can configure DataSync to use a specific SMB version, but we recommend doing this only if DataSync has trouble negotiating with the SMB file server automatically.\nThese are the following options for configuring the SMB version:\n\nAUTOMATIC (default): DataSync and the SMB file server negotiate the highest version of SMB that they mutually support between 2.1 and 3.1.1. This is the recommended option. If you instead choose a specific version that your file server doesnât support, you may get an Operation Not Supported error.\nSMB3 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 3.0.2.\nSMB2 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.1.\nSMB2_0 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.0.\nSMB1 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 1.0.\n\n\nNoteThe SMB1 option isnât available when creating an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP location .\nFormat your response as a single string using keyword arguments.",

For this operation, you canât use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you canât grant IAM permissions in policies. For more information about authorization models in Amazon Cognito, see Using the Amazon Cognito native and OIDC APIs .NoteThis action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.\nParameters:\n1. access_token - A non-expired access token for the user whose attribute verification code you want to generate.\n2. attribute_name - The attribute name returned by the server response to get the user attribute verification code.\n3. client_metadata - A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers.\nYou create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the GetUserAttributeVerificationCode API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the custom message trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your GetUserAttributeVerificationCode request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.\nFor more information, see Customizing user pool Workflows with Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .\n\nNoteWhen you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon Cognito wonât do the following:\n\nStore the ClientMetadata value.

App Runner requires this resource when you create or update App Runner services and you require non-default auto scaling settings. You can share an auto scaling configuration across multiple services.Configure a higher MinSize to increase the spread of your App Runner service over more Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region. The tradeoff is a higher minimal cost.See also: AWS API Documentation\n\nParameters:\n1. auto_scaling_configuration_name - A name for the auto scaling configuration. When you use it for the first time in an Amazon Web Services Region, App Runner creates revision number 1 of this name. When you use the same name in subsequent calls, App Runner creates incremental revisions of the configuration.\n\nNoteThe name DefaultConfiguration is reserved (itâs the configuration that App Runner uses if you donât provide a custome one). You canât use it to create a new auto scaling configuration, and you canât create a revision of it.\nWhen you want to use your own auto scaling configuration for your App Runner service, create a configuration with a different name , and then provide it when you create or update your service.\n2. max_concurrency - The maximum number of concurrent requests that you want an instance to process. If the number of concurrent requests exceeds this limit, App Runner scales up your service.\nDefault: 100\n3. min_size - The minimum number of instances that App Runner provisions for your service. The service always has at least MinSize provisioned instances. Some of them actively serve traffic. The rest of them (provisioned and inactive instances) are a cost-effective compute capacity reserve and are ready to be quickly activated. You pay for memory usage of all the provisioned instances. You pay for CPU usage of only the active subset.\nApp Runner temporarily doubles the number of provisioned instances during deployments, to maintain the same capacity for both old and new code.\nDefault: 1\n4. max_size - The maximum number of instances that your service scales up to. At most MaxSize instances actively serve traffic for your service.\nDefault: 25\n5. tags - A list of metadata items that you can associate with your auto scaling configuration resource.

We have also included the `starting_token` parameter, which is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.\nNote that the `max_items` parameter is not used in this case, as we are not interested in retrieving the maximum number of items available. However, if you want to retrieve the entire data set of results in a single call, you can set the `max_items` parameter to a large value, such as 1000."

If you set it LOGICAL , you need to provide mappings in the HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.\nPossible values:\n\nPATH\nLOGICAL\n3. home_directory_mappings - Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where Entry shows how the path is made visible and Target is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in Target . This value can be set only when HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL .\nThe following is an Entry and Target pair example.\n\n[ { \"Entry\": \"/directory1\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]\nIn most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory (âchroot â). To do this, you can set Entry to / and set Target to the HomeDirectory parameter value.\nThe following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot .\n\n[ { \"Entry\": \"/\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]\n(structure)\n\nRepresents an object that contains entries and targets for HomeDirectoryMappings .\nThe following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot .\n\n[ { \"Entry\": \"/\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]\nEntry -> (string)\n\nRepresents an entry for HomeDirectoryMappings .\nTarget -> (string)\n\nRepresents the map target that is used in a HomeDirectorymapEntry .\n4. policy - A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a userâs access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include ${Transfer:UserName} , ${Transfer:HomeDirectory} , and ${Transfer:HomeBucket} .\n\nNoteThis policy applies only when the domain of ServerId is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use session policies.\nFor session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the Policy argument.\nFor an example of a session policy, see Example session policy .\nFor more information, see AssumeRole in the Amazon Web ServicesSecurity Token Service API Reference .\n5. posix_profile - The full POSIX identity, including user ID (Uid ), group ID (Gid ), and any secondary groups IDs (SecondaryGids ), that controls your usersâ access to your Amazon EFS file systems. The POSIX permissions that are set on files and directories in your file system determine the level of access your users get when transferring files into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.\nUid -> (long)\n\nThe POSIX user ID used for all EFS operations by this user.\nGid -> (long)\n\nThe POSIX group ID used for all EFS operations by this user.\nSecondaryGids -> (list)\n\nThe secondary POSIX group IDs used for all EFS operations by this user.\n(long)\n6. role - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that controls your usersâ access to your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to access your resources when servicing your usersâ transfer requests.\n7. server_id - A system-assigned unique identifier for a server instance. This is the specific server that you added your user to.\n8. external_id - A unique identifier that is required to identify specific groups within your directory. The users of the group that you associate have access to your Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS resources over the enabled protocols using Transfer Family. If you know the group name, you can view the SID values by running the following command using Windows PowerShell.\n\nGet-ADGroup -Filter {samAccountName -like \"*YourGroupName* *\"} -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid\nIn that command, replace YourGroupName with the name of your Active Directory group.\nThe regular expression used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces.
